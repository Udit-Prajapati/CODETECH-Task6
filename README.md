# Overview
The project involves designing and implementing a Hotel Booking System database to manage rooms, customers, reservations, and payments efficiently. It ensures smooth booking operations, tracks customer and payment data, and supports complex queries for reporting and analytics.

# Key Activities
Designed database tables for key entities: Rooms, Customers, Reservations, and Payments.
Established relationships between tables using foreign keys to maintain data integrity.
Implemented complex queries to:
Check room availability for a given date range.
Calculate total revenue for a specific period.
Retrieve reservations linked to a specific customer.
Populated tables with sample data to test and validate the schema and queries.

# Technology Used
SQL: For creating tables, managing data, and executing queries.
MySQL Database: To store and query booking-related data.
Database Management Tools: MySQL Workbench (or alternatives) for schema design and query execution.

# Key Insights
Data Relationships: Effective use of foreign keys simplifies data retrieval and enforces referential integrity.
Query Optimization: Queries for availability checks and revenue calculation must account for large datasets; indexing can enhance performance.
Scalability: The schema is extensible, allowing the addition of new features like promotions, customer loyalty programs, or detailed room features.
Testing: Realistic sample data is crucial to identify and resolve potential edge cases and ensure reliable system behavior.
